# Introduction

This is homework project for lesson 1 of version 3 of [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) course.

I use Oxford VFF 102 flowers data set and a pretrained model to classify the flowers.

Why flowers? Because Cats vs. Dogs are only 2 categories and that is too easy for deep learning in 2019.
